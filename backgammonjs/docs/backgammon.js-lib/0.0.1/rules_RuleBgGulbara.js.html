 * Roll dice and generate list of moves the player has to make according to

 *
 * In this variant of the game moves for doubles are determined in the following way:
 * - In first three dice rolls (counted separately for each player) doubles are played
 *   as four moves - eg. 5:5 is played as [5,5,5,5].
 * - In all dice rolls after that, all doubles with values higher than the rolled one are played sequentially.
 *   For example 4:4 dice is played as [4,4,4,4], then [5,5,5,5] and finally [6,6,6,6],
 *   whereas 5:5 dice is played as [5,5,5,5] and [6,6,6,6].
 * - If the player cannot play all moves, but has moved at least one piece, then the other player
 *   finishes the moves that could not be played and then rolls the dice (as it is his turn).
